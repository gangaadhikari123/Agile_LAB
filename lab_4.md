TOPIC : AGILE ESTIMATION METRICS

OBJECTIVE :
     To understand and apply Agile estimation techiniques and metrics such as story points, velocity, and planning poker. The main goal is to evaluate how estimation improves predictability and planning in Agile projects.

TOOLS USED:
    1> Trello/Jira/Excle-for task tracking and sprint planning.
    2> Planning Poker app/cards- for collaborative estimation.
    3> Whiteboard or Notepad- for nottetaking and blockloggrooming.
    4> Agile Board or Spreadsheet- to calculate team velocity and track metrics

METHODOLOGY:
     This lab is divided into following activities:
      
      Step 1: Understanding Story Points
       ->Discussed story points as a unitless measure of effort and complexity.
       ->Compared with tasks by relative sizing (e.g.., a task twice aws hard as another = double the points).

      Step 2: Estimation with Planning Poker
       ->Formed teams of 4-6 members.
       ->Each team was given  a product backlog with server user stories.
       ->Used planning Poker to estimate each story collaboratively.
       ->Discussed different estimates and reached consensus.

      Step 3: Calculating Team Velocity
       ->Used estimated story points from hypothetical sprints.
       -> Sprint 1 completed in 20 story points
       -> Sprint 2 completed in 24 story points 
       -> Sprint 3 completed in 22 story points  
       ->Average team velocity = (20+24+22)/3 = 22 story points per sprint

      Step 4: Forecasting Future Work
       -> Given a backlog of 66 points and a velocity of 22.
       -> Estimated time to complete: 3 sprints

CONCLUSION:
     Agile estimation metrics provides a lightweight uet effective way to plan and manage tasks in a sprint. The lab reinforced the value of team collaboration in estimation and highlighted how consistent tracking improved project predictability.
